    "Question 1.  Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs  ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  A function is a mapping of zero or more input parameters to zero or more output parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing duplication of code\n",
    "Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces\n",
    "Improving clarity of the code\n",
    "Reuse of code\n",
    "Information hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are first-class citizens. It means that functions have equal status with other objects in Python. Functions can be assigned to variables, stored in collections, or passed as arguments. This brings additional flexibility to the language.\n",

    "Question 2.  When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called  ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "Question 3.  What statement creates a function  ?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.\n",
    "Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local. There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.\n",

    "\n",
    "Question 6.  What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns ?\n",

    "Answer:  When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed. Codelens helps you visualize this because the local variables disappear after the function returns.\n",

    "Answer:  A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. Its possible to have a return value in an expression.\n",

    "\n",
    "Question 9.  How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  The keyword 'Global' is also used to create or declare a global variable inside a function. Usually, when you create a variable inside a function (a local variable), it can only be used within that function."
