    "Answer: String is a value of repeating text wich is stored in a variable.\n",
    "e.g string = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable is a name that refer to any value.\n",

    "Question 3. Describe three different Data Types ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Text type: \n",
    "1. String (Immutable):- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Numeric Type:\n",
    "1. Integers (Immutable): 123456789, 9876543210. \n",
    "2.Floats (Immutable): 1.1, 3.14, 5.684, 14.3521.\n",
    "3. Complex (Immutable): 3 + 3i, 1 + 2j, 120 - 15x.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Sequence Type:\n",
    "1. Lists (Mutable): [A, B, C, D, E], [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].\n",
    "2. Tuples (Immutable): (A, 1, B, 2), (1, 2, 3, 4).\n",
    "3. Range : It is an in-built function in Python which returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and increments to 1 until it reaches a specified number. The most common use of range function is to iterate sequence type.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Mapping Type:\n",
    "1. Dictionaries (Mutable): {A:10, B:20, C:30}.\n",
    "\n",
    "E. Set Type:\n",
    "1. Sets (Mutable): {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}.\n",
    "2. frozensets : Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation. Frozen sets can be used as keys in Dictionary or as elements of another set.\n",
    "\n",
    "F. Boolean Type:\n",
    "1. Booleans (Immutable): True/False. \n",
    "\n",
    "G. Binary Type:\n",
    "1. There are 8 bits in a byte.\n",
    "2. Bits either consist of a 0 or a 1.\n",
    "3. A byte can be interpreted in different ways, like binary octal or hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "H. None Type:\n",
    "1. Nonetype: The None keyword in Python is a data type and an object of the NoneType class. The None keyword is used for defining a null variable or an object in Python. None can be assigned to any variable, but new NoneType objects cannot be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. e.g. print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Statements are instructions that perform some sort of action, but do not produce any value. Statements are used to control the flow of the program and carry out various tasks, such as defining variables, making decisions, and looping through data. \n",
    "e.g of Statement\n",
    "Course_name = \"Data Science\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are code constructs that evaluate to a value. Expressions can contain variables, operators, and function calls, and can be used in a variety of contexts, such as assignments, print statements, and return statements. An expression always evaluates to a single value, which can be of any data type (such as integer, float, string, etc.).\n",
